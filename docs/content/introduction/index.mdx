# xLSTM and TiRex for Time Series Forecasting

<Badges />

---

TiRex is a 35M parameter pre-trained time series forecasting model based on [xLSTM](https://github.com/NX-AI/xlstm).

## Key Facts:
- **Zero-Shot Forecasting:** TiRex is a pre-trained model that performs time series forecasting without requiring any training on your data. Simply download and use it.

- **Quantile Predictions:** TiRex provides both point estimates and quantile estimates.

- **State-of-the-art Performance over Long and Short Horizons:** TiRex achieves top scores in various time series forecasting benchmarks, see [GiftEval](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Salesforce/GIFT-Eval) and [ChronosZS](https://huggingface.co/spaces/autogluon/fev-leaderboard). These benchmark show that TiRex provides great performance for both long and short-term forecasting.

## Brief Background
**xLSTM (Extended Long Short-Term Memory)** is a powerful new architecture for sequence modeling, building upon the success of traditional LSTMs. It introduces key innovations that enhance its ability to capture long-range dependencies and complex patterns in data, making it particularly well-suited for tasks like time series forecasting.

**TiRex** leverages the power of xLSTM to provide a state-of-the-art framework for time series forecasting. By utilizing the advanced sequence modeling capabilities of xLSTM, TiRex can generate accurate forecasts across various time horizons and data characteristics — without being trained on task-specific data. This capability is referred to *zero-shot* forecasting.

## Potential Applications

TiRex can be applied to a wide range of real-world time series forecasting problems, including (but not limited to):

- **Demand Forecasting:** Estimating future product demand for inventory management and supply chain optimization.
- **Energy Forecasting:** Predicting electricity consumption or renewable energy generation.
- **Traffic Forecasting:** Anticipating traffic flow for urban planning and navigation systems.
- **Environmental Forecasting:** Modeling climate patterns or predicting pollution levels.
